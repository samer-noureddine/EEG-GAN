# EEG-GAN

This is a very simple generative adversarial network (GAN), adapted from a handwritten digit-generating tutorial by Balint Gersey that was apparently taken down from the web since. Here, I show how this relatively simple GAN can be trained to successfully synthesize single-epoch EEG data from one channel.
