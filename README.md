# EEG-GAN

This is a simple generative adversarial network (GAN), adapted from a handwritten digit-generating tutorial by Balint Gersey (the code is at the end of his ![MS thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326676131_Generative_Adversarial_Networks). The GAN was trained to successfully synthesize single-epoch EEG (i.e., time-series) data from one channel. The output looks like this:
