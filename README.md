# EEG-GAN

This is a simple generative adversarial network (GAN), adapted from a handwritten digit-generating tutorial by Balint Gersey (the code is at the end of his MS thesis, which I can no longer find). The GAN was trained to successfully synthesize single-epoch EEG (i.e., time-series) data from one channel. The output looks like this:
